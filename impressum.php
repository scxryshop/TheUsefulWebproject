            </b>
            <p>Pursuant to § 7, Para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG), as a service provider
                we are responsible under general law for our own contents on this website.
                According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to
                monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
                circumstances that indicate illegal activity. The obligation to remove or block the
                use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this.
                However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a
                concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any such
                infringements, we will remove the relevant content immediately.</p>

                <h3>Liability for links</h3>
            </b>
            <p>Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we
                have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external
                contents. The respective provider or operator of the websites is always responsible
                for the content of these pages. The sites were checked for potential illegal content
                at the time the links were created. Illegal content was not detected at the time the
                links were created. Moreover, a permanent control of the contents of the linked
                websites shall not be considered reasonable without a concrete indication for a
                violation of the law and will not be carried out. We will immediately remove such
                contents upon discovery of infringements.
