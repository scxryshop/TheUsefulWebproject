            <p>Pursuant to § 7, Para. 1 TMG, as a service provider we are responsible under
                general law for our own content on this website. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG,
                however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or
                stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
                activity. The obligation to remove or block the use of information in accordance with
                general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only
                possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law
                becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove
                the relevant content immediately.</p>

                <h3>Liability for links</h3>
            </b>
            <p>Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we
                have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume liability for any external content.
                The respective provider or operator of the websites is always responsible for the
                content of these pages. The websites were checked for potential illegal content at
                the time the links were created. However, illegal content was not detected at that
                time. Moreover, a permanent control of the content of the linked websites shall not
                be considered reasonable without a concrete indication for a violation of a law and
                will not be carried out. We will immediately remove such content upon discovery of
                infringements.
